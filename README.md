# Wheres My Glasses (Frontend)
Virtual assistant for object location around the smart home and people with dementia.

Uses the Snips voice platform for speech processing (ASR/STT, NLU, TTS).

https://snips.ai/

The "LocateObject" intent triggers a search for an object by sending a request to the Wheres My Glasses backend. Backend responds with potential location data of the requested object using object detection.

E.g.

"Hey Snips... Where's my glasses?"

"I can see your glasses, they're on your head!"
