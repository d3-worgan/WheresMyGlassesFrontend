# Wheres My Glasses (Frontend)
Action code for a voice assistant that handles requests relating to locating objects around the smart home.
Originally designed to run offline (on device) on raspberry pi and work with
the [associated backend system](https://github.com/d3-worgan/WheresMyGlassesBackend) to form a private 
smart home object location assistant.

Unfortunately the voice platform Snips is no longer supported. The project needs to be tested to work with something 
like [Rhasspy](https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy) (open source) or some other assistant like google or alexa.
